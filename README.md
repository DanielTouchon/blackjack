This is a learning project where I tried to reproduce the game of Blackjack/21. Using Python and the
command line interface, the user is dealt a hand and so are a number of AI_players and the dealer.
The user can decide between a hit or standing. I recreated the exact odds of a real deck and gave the
AI_Players a "risk_level" that determines whether they will hit or stand.
