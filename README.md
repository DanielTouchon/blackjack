This is a learning project where I tried to reproduce the game of Blackjack/21. Using Python and the
command line interface, the user is dealt a hand and so is the dealer. The user can decide between a
hit or a call (keep going or end the game). Using a filter mechanism, I tried to reproduce the exact
odds a Blackjack/21 player would have to receive each card.
